MM/I
====

This is the Polyglot Symposium's first experience in language design and
compiler construction. We are doing it in Python because of the rapid
development, though if we were to ultimately build a legitimate language, we
would probably do it in Haskell.

MM/I is short for
[Michelson-Morley](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelson%E2%80%93Morley_experiment)
One, meaning our first attempt at a failed experiment. Our physics professor
used to say that this was the biggest failed experiment in all of science. Not a
statement I would want to defend rigorously, but it inspired the name of this
language. This is not a language built to be a language. This is a language
built to be a failure. We intend to learn by failing. Perhaps if we fail enough
we will build a real language some day.
